# PlugHunt
A simple prop hunt game. The host will be the hunter, all other players will be props.
Movement with arrow keys, no other actions yet.

The props can hide on the map amongst random items, if the hunter gets close to them, the connected toys will start vibrating.
Ideally this is played on a voice call or similar, and the hunter can try to use the players voice to guess if they are close (to them).
